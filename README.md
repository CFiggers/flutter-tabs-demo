# flutter-tabs-demo

A new Flutter project by Caleb, following the [Work With Tabs](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/tabs) cookbook example on the Flutter documentation website. But implemented using [ClojureDart](https://github.com/Tensegritics/ClojureDart).

## Getting Started

1. Set up Dart, Flutter, and ClojureDart.

2. Clone this repo.

3. Initialize the project using `clj -M -m cljd.build init layout-tutorial.main`.

4. Fire up a target device (such as an Android emulator using Android Studio).

5. Start the ClojureDart watcher using `clj -M -m cljd.build flutter`.
